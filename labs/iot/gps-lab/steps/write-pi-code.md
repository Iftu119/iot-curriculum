# Code the Raspberry Pi to send GPS data to IoT Hub

In the [previous step](./set-up-pi.md) you set up the Raspberry Pi to receive GPS signals from the GPS receiver.

In this step you will write code to gather GPS data and send it to your IoT Hub.

## Connect to the Pi

You will need a coding environment on the Pi that supports Python. The recommended ways are:

* **Visual Studio Code Remote Development** - run VS Code on a PC or Mac and connect remotely to the Pi. You can read how to do this in the [Microsoft Raspberry Pi resources](https://github.com/microsoft/rpi-resources/tree/master/remote-coding)
* **Visual Studio Code running on the Pi** - run VS Code on the Pi directly. From the Pi head to [code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads?WT.mc_id=academic-7372-jabenn), and download the ARM .deb package. Run this on the Pi to install VS Code.



## Next steps

In this step you wrote write code to gather GPS data and send it to your IoT Hub.

In the [next step](./web-app.md) you will write a web application to visualize the GPS location on Azure Maps.
