# Build AI models to make predictions on temperatures

In the [previous step](./anomaly-detection.md) you performed more advanced analytics to detect and visualize anomalies in the data.

In this step you will build AI models to make predictions on temperatures.

## Azure Machine Learning Studio

**Coming soon**

## Temperature prediction

Use known air temperature data
Clean up and correlate with the measured data
Use in AutoML to get model
Use to predict internal temp based on weather tomorrow
Output to another cosmos DB table

Create Jupyter notebook to visualize?

Get US data from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/qcdatasets.html
Outside US - find your own data, raise a PR to get/transform

## Next steps

In this step you built AI models to make predictions on temperatures.

In the [next step](./clean-up.md) you will clean up your Azure resources.
