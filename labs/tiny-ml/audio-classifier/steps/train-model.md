# Train the TinyML model

In the [previous step](./audio-capture.md) you programed the Arduino device to capture audio data ready to classify to train the model. In this step you will use the output from the audio capture to train a TinyML model.

## Next steps

In this step, you used the output from the audio capture to train a TinyML model. In the [next step](./audio-classifier.md) you will use this model to create an audio classifier.
