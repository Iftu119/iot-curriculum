# Audio Classifier

This folder contains a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) project to build an audio classifier app that runs on an [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense) board.

You can read more about this project in the [top level README.md file](../README.md).

To build and deploy this project, you will need to open this folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-7372-jabenn) with the [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) installed. You will then be able to build the project and upload to a Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board.

## Building this project

This project has a library dependency on the ARM CMSIS static library. You will need to download this from the ARM GitHub repo.

* Head to [the CMSIS GCC libs folder in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/tree/5.7.0/CMSIS/DSP/Lib/GCC)
* Download `libarm_cortexM4l_math.a` from that repo page
* Add the file to the root folder of this project

You will also need to add code to the [`classifier.h`](./src/classifier.h) file. This code is generated by the model training utility. Refer to the [top level README.md file](../README.md) for more details on creating the contents of this file.

## Running the project

Once the project is running on the board, it will listen for audio, classify based on a trained model, then output the label of the predicted value to the serial port.

* Connect to the serial monitor to view the audio values
* Make the one of the relevant noises into the microphone of the board. Pause after each noise and you will see the predicted label for that sound output to the serial monitor.
