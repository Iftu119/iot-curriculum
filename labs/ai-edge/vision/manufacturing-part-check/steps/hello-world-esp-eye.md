# Program the ESP-EYE with a simple 'Hello World' program

In this step you will configure your computer to program the ESP-EYE, and create your first 'Hello World' program running on the board.

## ESP-EYE

The ESP-EYE is a board based around the ESP32 microcontroller, with a built in camera module. This board is programmed in C++, using Platform IO.

## Platform IO

[Platform IO](https://platformio.org) is an open source extension for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=iotcurriculum-github-jabenn) (VS Code) that gives you the ability to program embedded devices without any additional dependencies.

### Install Platform IO

To install Platform IO:

* Make sure you have VS Code installed. If not, you can install it from the [Visual Studio Code Downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download?WT.mc_id=iotcurriculum-github-jabenn)
* From VS Code, select the **Extensions** tab from the side menu
