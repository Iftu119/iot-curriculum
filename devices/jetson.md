# NVIDIA Jetson

The [NVIDIA Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing) range of devices are high performance, low power devices that run AI models on the edge using multiple PU cores.

You can compare the different Jetson devices on the [Jetson Hardware page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware#family).

These devices can run the Azure IoT Edge runtime and host AI models trained in the cloud that do real-time computer vision inference. The results of this inference can then be sent to the cloud.
