# Arduino

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

## Arduino Resources

* [Azure IoT Hub library for Arduino](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-arduino) - This library is a port of the Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for C to Arduino. It allows you to use several Arduino compatible boards with Azure IoT Hub
* [Securely stream data with command and control support from an ESP8266 MCUs to Azure IoT Hub over Secure MQTT](https://github.com/gloveboxes/Arduino-ESP8266-Secure-Mqtt-Azure-IoT-Hub-Client) - This solution securely streams sensor data directly to Azure IoT Hub over a secure MQTT connection from ESP8266 MCUs.
* [Securely stream data from ESP8266 MCUs to Azure IoT Hub or Azure IoT Central over HTTPS](https://github.com/gloveboxes/Arduino-ESP8266-Secure-Http-Azure-IoT-Hub-Client-V2) - This solution securely streams sensor data directly to Azure IoT Hub over HTTPS calling Azure REST APIs from an ESP8266 MCU.
* [Azure IoT Hub and Arduino Sample](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/AzureIoTArduinoSample) - sample code for using Azure IoT Hub with Arduino boards.
